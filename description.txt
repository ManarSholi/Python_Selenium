Lets say you get hired as a test engineer at a web development company.
Every day you have to test various functions of the website. Doing this
requires a lot of manual repetitive work. You have to lunch your browser,
direct it to the address of your website, click on a few links here and
there perhaps fill out a form, and repeat all these with different values
severals times a day.

This si several time consuming and it doesn't scale. So that's where
selenium comes into the picture.

With selenium we can automate our browser, so we can write a bunch of
scripts to test various functions on a website.

Simple example:

Let's say we want to test the login functionality of the GitHub.com.
So,
1. we have to launch our browser
2. head over to GitHub.com
3. click on the sign link
4. fill out the form.
5. login
6. click on your avatar
7. check if your name appears on the menu, if not, that means there's 
something wrong with the login functionality.

Using Selenium:
1. pipenv install selenium
2. We need a driver, The driver is a piece of software to automate a
specific browser, for all these popular browsers like chrome, firefox
and so on, we have a web driver that we need to manually download. So,
1. head over to pypi.org.
2. search for selenium.
3. on the Drivers section, choose a browser, and download it.
